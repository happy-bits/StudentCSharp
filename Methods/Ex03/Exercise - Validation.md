Validation rules:
- the list of people can't be empty
- The amount of characters in a name have to be between 2 and 9
 

## Hint

Add a method

    bool PeopleArrayIsValid(string[] peopleArray)

…that returns true if peopleArray has at least one element and all names in the array is have a length of 2 to 9 letters.
