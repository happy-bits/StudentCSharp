# Car 5


Use properties for **Color** and **Weight** to simplify the code a bit:

    var c1 = new Car("blue", 1200); 
    var c2 = new Car("red", 800);   
    var c3 = new Car();             

    Console.WriteLine($"The color of car1 is {c1.Color} and the weight is {c1.Weight}");
    Console.WriteLine($"The color of car2 is {c2.Color} and the weight is {c2.Weight}");
    Console.WriteLine($"The color of car3 is {c3.Color} and the weight is {c3.Weight}");
